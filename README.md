# Next.js 15 App Router: Silent Fetch Failure in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's `app` directory when using the built-in `fetch` API within a component's `useEffect` hook.  The issue arises when fetching data during the initial render without specifying dependencies.

**Problem:** The `fetch` call might fail silently or return stale data, leading to unexpected application behavior. This is particularly problematic in scenarios relying on dynamic data during initial page load.

**Solution:** The provided solution utilizes the `use` keyword in the app directory.  This ensures data fetching happens before the component renders, thus preventing the silent failure or stale data return.  Additionally, proper error handling and loading states are implemented to provide a better user experience.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the initial render's behavior and compare it to the corrected version.
